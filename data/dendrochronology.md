# Dendrochronology

Dendrochronology is the method of dating tree rings to the exact year they were formed in a tree.

As of 2024, only three areas have continuous sequences going back to prehistoric times, the foothills of the Northern Alps, the south-western United States and the British Isles. Miyake events, which are major spikes in cosmic rays at known dates, are visible in trees rings and can fix the dating of a floating sequence.
