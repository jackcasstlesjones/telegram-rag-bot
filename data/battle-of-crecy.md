Philip VI (France) vs. Edward III.

## Dan Snow History Hit Podcast

- Because of the culture of chivalry, knights would rather die than be accused of cowardice. When reaching the English, Philip ordered his army to stop, but because everyone wanted to be at the front (the ones at the back tried to push forward, the ones at the front kept pushing so they would stay at the front), they ended up approaching the English.
- Philip just ordered to attack seeing as they were all there now.
- Interestingly, the hosts Dan Snow and Tim Harford from the Cautionary tales podcast discussed the reluctance of Philip to respect the crossbowmen. This reluctance to accept new military technology can be seen in [[refusal-to-accept-evolving-military-technology|other occurrences]] in history.
